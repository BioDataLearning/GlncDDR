# lncDDR
In this study, we developed a machine learning method, lncDDR, to predict lncRNAs associated with DNA damage response (DDR). The lncDDR models used relevant features derived from TCGA transcriptome dataset through autoencoder.The lncDDR models achieved consistent performance on both training and test dataset. Finally, the model was applied for prediction of lncRNAs associated with DDR.
